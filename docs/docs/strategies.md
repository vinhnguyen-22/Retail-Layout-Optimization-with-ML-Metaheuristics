## The strategy of running FP-Growth first, followed by HUIM (EFIM)
This is a two-stage process that **combines frequency analysis with value-based analysis**. It is designed to effectively capture both commonly co-purchased product relationships and high-revenue-contributing itemsets. Specifically:

-	**FP-Growth** is used in the initial stage to identify groups of products that are frequently bought together in the same transaction. The goal is to reduce the search space by focusing only on frequent combinations rather than all possible ones.
-	**HUIM (EFIM)** is then applied to evaluate the actual utility of these combinations, identifying which itemsets generate high revenue - regardless of how frequently they appear.

## Appling Genetic Algorithm (GA) in Store Layout Optimization:
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is **an optimization technique inspired by the principles of natural selection**, well-suited for solving complex combinatorial problems with large search spaces and multiple constraints. When applied to store layout optimization, GA helps identify the most effective arrangement of product groups to maximize business value. The process typically involves the following steps:

-	**Initialization:** Generate a set of random layout configurations.
-	**Evaluation:** Assess the performance of each layout using a fitness function based on criteria such as total revenue and product group synergy.
-	**Generation:** Produce new layout options by combining and mutating the most effective configurations.
-	**Iteration:** Repeat the process across multiple generations to gradually improve solution quality.
