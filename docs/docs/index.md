# Project Overview
In modern retail, analyzing customer purchasing behavior is essential for optimizing both business performance and operational efficiency. In particular, identifying high-value product combinations that are frequently purchased together enables the implementation of key strategies such as optimizing store layout, promoting cross-selling and increasing average transaction value.

This project applies the **High-Utility Pattern Mining (HUPM)** technique – a method for discovering combinations of product groups (itemsets, specifically NH2 – product group level 2 in this project) based not only on their frequency of occurrence but also on the value they generate (utility, represented by sales in this project). By analyzing historical transaction data, the project aims to:

- Identify high-utility product sets that frequently occur within the same transaction;
- Extract valuable product relationships to support data-driven product placement decisions in-store;
- Optimize the customer shopping journey and improve cross-purchasing opportunities;
- Enhance merchandising strategies by leveraging transaction data to increase space efficiency and revenue per store.
